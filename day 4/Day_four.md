# DAY 4
## Objective
In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. Check out the 
[Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an 
instructional video.

## Task
Given an integer, _**n**_, perform the following conditional actions:
- If _**n**_ is odd, print Weird
- If _**n**_ is even and in the inclusive range of _**2**_ to _**5**_, print Not Weird
- If _**n**_ is even and in the inclusive range of _**6**_ to _**20**_, print Weird
- If _**n**_ is even and greater than _**20**_, print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not _**n**_ is weird.

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, _**n**_.

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 100

## Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

## Sample Input 0
````
3
````

## Sample Output 0
````
Weird
````
## Sample Input 1
```
24
```
## Sample Output 1
````
Not Weird
````
## Explanation

Sample Case 0: _**n = 3**_

_**n**_ is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: _**n = 24**_

_**n > 20**_ and _**n**_ is even, so it is not weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
