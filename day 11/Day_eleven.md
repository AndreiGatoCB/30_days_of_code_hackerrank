# DAY 11
## Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the 
[Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an 
instructional video!

## Task
Given a base-_**10**_ integer, _**n**_, convert it to binary (base-_**2**_). Then find and print the base-_**10**_ 
integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive _**1**_'s in _**n**_'s binary representation. When working with 
different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

## Example
_**n = 125**_

The binary representation of _**125 (dec)**_ is _**1111101 (bin)**_. In base _**10**_, there are _**5**_ and _**1**_ 
consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, _**5**_.

## Input Format

A single integer, _**n**_.

## Constraints
- _**1 <= n <= 10^6**_

## Output Format

Print a single base-_**10**_ integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive _**1**_'s in the binary 
representation of _**n**_.

## Sample Input 1
````
5
````
## Sample Output 1
````
1
````
## Sample Input 2
````
13
````
## Sample Output 2
````
2
````
## Explanation

Sample Case 1:

The binary representation of _**5 (dec)**_ is _**101 (bin)**_, so the maximum number of consecutive _**1**_'s is 
_**1**_.

Sample Case 2:

The binary representation of _**13 (dec)**_ is _**1101 (bin)**_, so the maximum number of consecutive _**1**_'s is 
_**2**_.
