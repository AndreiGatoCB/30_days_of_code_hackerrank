# 30 DAYS OF CODE of HackerRank
## By AndreiGatoCB

This is my 30 days of code challenge, I'll work on this for 30 days to improve my code skills, here I'll add the proves 
of my progress and talk about all the things that I didn't know before.

### Day 1
The day one helped me to understand the _**#TODO**_ tags and why you can't _commit and push_ your repository, so, you
have to edit the tag to be able to _commit and push_ your progress.
