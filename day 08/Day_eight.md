# DAY 8
## Objective
Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. Check out the 
[Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional 
video.

## Task
Given an array, _**A**_, of _**N**_ integers, print _**A**_'s elements in reverse order as a single line of 
space-separated numbers.

## Example


Print ``4 3 2 1``. Each integer is separated by one space.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, _**N**_ (the size of our array).

The second line contains _**N**_ space-separated integers that describe array _**A**_'s elements.

## Constraints
- _**1 <= N <= 1000**_
- _**1 <= A[i] <= 10000**_, where _**A[i]**_ is the _**i-th**_ integer in the array.
## Output Format

Print the elements of array _**A**_ in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Sample Input
````
4
1 4 3 2
````
## Sample Output
````
2 3 4 1
````
